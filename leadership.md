**Statement**:
Computer science education has advanced significantly in the past few years, but students still struggle to bridge the gap between programming coursework and real-world code.
While traditional computer science courses successfully teach all the components of computing, they often fail to give a big picture of how to use those skills in practice.
Students are taught how to program in isolation, where each project starts from scratch or from a small idealized codebase, but what really matters is being able to jump into an existing community and work on a project that may already comprise thousands of lines of code.

**Recommendation**:
The only way to learn how to be successful in software development is to do it.
Homework problems that can be implemented in less than a hundred lines will never teach students what programming is actually like.
Thankfully, the open source community provides an opportunity for students of all ages to experience authentic software development and learn how to use their skills in a more comprehensive way.
Once students learn in the basics of programming in their coursework, they should put it to the test by contributing to open source software.
Not only would this teach students how to work in a real software development environment, but it also gives them the opportunity to give back to the community at the same time.
Students can also benefit from the diverse community of open source developers who are willing and able to guide new contributors, providing a wide array of perspectives that students may not have access to in the traditional classroom setting.
Lastly, because each new open source contribution likely requires the student to learn and research aspects of it independently, it will be much more insightful than coursework which is less open-ended.

**Implementation**:
Although students from all levels would benefit from such a reform, my proposed solution targets college students with computing-related majors, as these are the students most likely to work in a traditional software development setting.
Specifically, I will direct the program toward the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at the University of South Carolina because I have observed an explicit need within the department, and I have a relationship with the Open Source South Carolina meetup group which would help me implement the change.
Getting involved in the open source community is an important early step in computer science education because it provides context when students are learning to program, and it gives students an opportunity to practice their skills as they learn.
For this reason, I will focus my attention on augmenting the introductory programming courses: CSCE 145, 146, and specifically 240 which is currently just an introduction to C++.

The first step in my proposed solution is to work with the current professors of CSCE 240 to transform the projects to reflect a more realistic work environment.
While many of the initial assignments would stay the same, they would use GitHub Education for submissions and require students to learn certain aspects of the git version control system alongside C++ because git is critical for managing any large project.
Once students have progressed to a stage where they could feasibly contribute to open source software, the projects would primarily take the shape of designing solutions to small issues within large open source projects.
These assignments would still be scripted to allow fair and convenient grading, but they would closely mimic real-world scenarios which are not as clear-cut as traditional class assignments.
Other assignments may focus more on learning software development practices than the programming itself, such as searching for specific features within large code bases, resolving merge conflicts when combining two branches of a piece of code, or competing to resolve the most issues on real open-source projects over the course of the semester.
While the additional focus of software development practices may detract from the amount of time spent teaching C++, students should learn the important programming concepts along the way.

In order to have students take open source contribution to a more individual level, I will also work with the local Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) student chapter to host a hackathon with a focus on open source contribution.
While the event would be open to the general public, participation would be required by students in CSCE 240 to encourage open source outside of the classroom.
Students would be able to work on any project, whether as a contributor to an existing project or as the creator of a new project, following only a loose rubric for how their participation will be evaluated toward the class.
The primary goal will be for students to explore topics that are interesting to them and learn more personalized skills along the way.

Another important aspect of open source is the community behind it.
Ideally students will be able to interact with software developers in their independent projects, but I will also invite local professionals from the Open Source South Carolina meetup group to give workshop talks at the hackathon on topics related to their specific experiences in open source and software development in general.
Even more important than the talks themselves will be the opportunity for students to ask questions and get to know the speakers on a more personal level.
The local open source community is a valuable resource, and by making these relationships, students will feel welcomed into the community.

**Evaluation**:
Because my proposed solution takes away from the time spent teaching explicit C++ programming concepts in CSCE 240, students will likely have seemingly lesser capabilities on traditional assessments which consider only a student's ability to write small pieces of code for fairly straightforward tasks.
Therefore, I will look instead at the longer-term performance of students who take the revised CSCE 240 versus the original course.
Specifically, we will assess both the average GPA in subsequent courses and the extent to which students make open source contributions on GitHub after the course ends.
I expect students to perform better in the later coursework because they have already mastered the skills necessary for more complex assignments and because they have a more personal connection to computer science than they would have otherwise.
I also hope to see a significant number of students remaining active in the open source community after they have completed the requirements through the semester.
