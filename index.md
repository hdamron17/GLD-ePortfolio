My name is Hunter Damron, and I am a computer science and mathematics double major at the University of South Carolina.
I will graduate in May 2021 with Leadership Distinction in Research.

My undergraduate research experience began in November 2017 when I started working with Dr. Ioannis Rekleitis in the Autonomous Field Robotics Lab.
Since joining, I have worked on a variety of projects in localization and planning for underwater robots, resulting in three conference publications, one as first author which I presented in Madrid, Spain.
The highlight of my experience in the lab was the winter of 2018-19 when I travelled with Dr. Rekleitis to Holetown, Barbados for three weeks of field trials and collaboration with other underwater roboticists.

As part of my graduation with Distinction in Mathematics, I am also working with Dr. László Székely of the math department to count the number of symmetrical domino tilings of a rectangle, i.e. how many ways dominos can be arranged such they cover the whole rectangle completely with no overlap, and considering two tilings equivalent if they differ only by a rotation or mirroring action.

In addition to research, I was also the president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) student chapter at the University of South Carolina, a role which allowed me to share my passion for research and competitive programming with the entirety of the Computer Science and Engineering Department.
Together with the ACM executive board, I planned our biannual Codeathon, a competitive programming event, as well as many talks by students and local professionals on a variety of topics.

Outside of academia, I was vice chair of the Gamecock Sailing Keelboat Team.
With the team, I competed in regattas from Charleston to Chicago and put my teaching skills to the test when training new sailors.

Through the course of my time at the University of South Carolina, I have learned a lot of skills, but the most important skill I have refined is how to learn.
Through interacting with a diverse group of peers and mentors, I have come to appreciate the diversity, both culturally and academically, that makes university learning so unique.
Through my experience in research and open source software, I have recognized how important it is for me to give back to the community using the skills I have learned, both for my own sake and for the sake of pushing the community forward.
Lastly, because of the benefit that independent research and exploration has had in my academic career, often in unexpected ways, I believe it should be a critical component of the education system in general.

After graduation, I will begin working as a software developer at Epic Systems in Madison, Wisconsin.
With Epic, I will develop tools for healthcare record keeping and analysis that will help save the lives of many people around the globe.
