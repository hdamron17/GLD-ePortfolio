## Sharing with the community

As an Eagle Scout, I have always been fond of giving back to my community, whether through service projects or charity.
In my time as an undergraduate researcher, I have discovered that it is just as important to contribute to the research community through papers and conference presentations.
Research is all about building upon the current knowledge base to make new discoveries, so it relies heavily on a clear understanding of what has already been done.
By sharing your contribution with the scientific community, you can push forward exploration and lay the foundation for future research.

In fall of my sophomore year, I made my own contribution to robotics research as the first author of the paper "Underwater Surveying via Bearing only Cooperative Localization" which I presented at the 2018 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).
After working for several months writing code and analyzing data from field trials, I was excited to travel to Madrid and present my work.
From attending other presentations, I also learned various techniques that have been useful in my research.
In artifact 1, I present my paper and video presentation for the project to show how I contributed to the robotics field as an undergraduate student.

In addition to scientific contribution, the field of computer science greatly benefits from open source software which is freely available and is maintained by the community.
In my research and schoolwork, I regularly depend on open source software such as ROS for robot synchronization and OpenCV for computer vision.
In fact, most programming languages are built on an open source.
Because I have gained so much from open source, I made my own contribution in the summer of 2020 as a maintainer of the Saltwater C Compiler, a rewrite of the C compiler in Rust.
Although the project itself likely will never reach production quality, I gained important skills that I will use to apply to more useful projects in the future.
Artifact 2 is a link to the project with a link specifically to one of my primary contributions as well.

In my classes, I have also had the opportunity to share my work.
Specifically in MATH 599 (Mathematics of Machine Learning), each student presented on a topic in machine learning relevant to them.
Because each student came with a unique background the presentations introduced interesting topics that would not have been covered in the normal course.
I shared my experience in robotics through a presentation on the difficulty of walking, a task seemingly trivial for humans.
In artifact 3, I give the slides of my talk to show how I related my research area to the course topics.
