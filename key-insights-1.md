## Diverse Perspectives Make Learning Personal

In November of my freshman year, I joined the Autonomous Field Robotics Lab (AFRL) led by Dr. Ioannis Rekeleitis.
Coming from a rural South Carolina town, it was a shock to be one of only two Americans in the group.
Through my experiences in class and in robotics research, I have learned to cherish such diversity because each person is able to bring a unique perspective to the discussion.
Even more importantly, working with a diverse community allows you to work together and make connections between the various perspectives, leading to a deeper understanding and a more humanized relationship with the subject matter.

In spring 2019, I was able to experience three different perspectives on the same topic through LING 101 (Mathematical Linguistics), CSCE 531 (Compiler Design), and MATH 562 (Theory of Computation).
All three courses were centered on the topic of parsing language, but each brought its own goals and techniques.
In the linguistics course, we studied human and animal language from a mathematical perspective, but considering also that real language cannot be fully explained by mathematics.
In the computer science course, we were concerned with using deterministic finite automata (DFAs) to parse programming languages and turn them into a language executable by the computer.
Finally, the mathematics course emphasized proving concepts about the different complexities of languages and about the limits of computation.
Because I experienced the same topic from three different perspectives, I gained a deeper understanding of its significance across fields.
In artifacts 1A-C, I show how the same topic was portrayed in all three courses.
Artifact 1A shows how LING 505 made connections between the purely mathematical study of language and the more realistic study of natural language.
Artifact 1C, on the other hand, deals with the very abstract nature of language parsing using a DFA.
In Artifact 1B, this same concept of a DFA is put into practice using the Yacc toolchain which parses source code in a Look Ahead Left-to-Right (LALR) style.
Each of the three deals with essentially the same core idea, but each has a distinctly different goal and way of achieving it.

Not only is academic diversity important to learning, but also cultural diversity.
In my mathematical linguistics course, I was often able to contribute helpful examples of linguistic concepts because of my concurrent study of the German language.
In addition, another student with Indian heritage often shared her experience with Hindi to demonstrate linguistic structures that are not present in English.
Overall, my experience in the course taught me how learning can benefit from collaboration among people with diverse cultures and backgrounds.

Outside of class, my research has led me to appreciate the diversity of the robotics community.
One key research experience was when I travelled with my advisor, Dr. Ioannis Rekelitis, and PhD student, Nare Karapetyan, to the Bellairs Research Center in Holetown, Barbados in the Winter of 2018-19.
In Barbados, we joined researchers from universities in Canada, Minnesota, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire to conduct field trials of our underwater robots and collaborate on various topics.
After discussing with each of the teams, we discovered a common problem in underwater robotics -- unreliable state estimation.
This realization led to my current project of combining a visual-inertial localization system with a simple motion model of the robot, internally known as the Uberestimator.
In the spring of 2019, I undertook a SCHC SURF Grant to support the project, and the application is attached as Artifact 2.
In the proposal, you can see how my experience in Barbados sparked a completely new direction of research which I have worked on for two years.

In the summer of 2020, I again joined a diverse group of students for for the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute Summer Scholars program (RISS).
The program let me collaborate with students from 11 countries in multiple time zones with various interests spanning the entirety of robotics.
Unlike my previous work which was up to that point centered solely on underwater localization, I explored a new topic of traffic sign detection for self-driving cars.
During the course of the summer, I became especially involved with the communications team.
As a member of the team, I helped showcase the program and the diverse cohort by designing the final journal, among other things.
I present this final journal as artifact 3 to show how we were able to the unique perspectives that each student brought to the program.

I believe any activity, whether academic or not, benefits greatly from a diverse community.
In learning specifically, diverse perspectives can take abstract material and give it tangible connections through the experiences and backgrounds of the people involved.
By bringing together people who think differently, the results can only be great.
When you think about any great mind in history, what made them great was not necessarily how skilled they were within their specific field, but how they could change the field itself by bringing in new ways of thinking.
As an amazing example, Paul Erdős transformed combinatorics by bringing in probability, a topic on the opposite side of mathematics.
However, he did not do this alone, but rather through continued collaboration with researchers from all branches of math and even outside of math.
We should all take inspiration from Erdős's life and surround ourselves with people who think differently than ourselves.
