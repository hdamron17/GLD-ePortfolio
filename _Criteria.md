## Key Insights
The GLD ePortfolio requires three (3) major learning statements that articulate how your

order to create a change in your professional or life practices. Key insights also analyze
topics or issues in order to demonstrate your ability to think critically and see things from
various perspectives.

A key insight identifies learning that has been transformative to you and that has caused a
change in your behavior or way of thinking.

  your learning?
